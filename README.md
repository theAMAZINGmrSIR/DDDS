# Dooms Day Delivery Service (DDDS)

**Dooms Day Delivery Service** is a satirical **B-horror courier game** built in **Unreal Engine 5**.  
You play as the **Asset Manager**, a remote operator controlling disposable 3D-printed Employees via drone.  

Your mission: **drive your delivery truck into danger, print a fresh Employee, and guide them on foot through apocalyptic hazards to drop off packages.**  
Along the way, you‚Äôll collect Bio-Matter to print more Employees, fend off rival mascots, and review obituaries for each poor soul that doesn‚Äôt make it.

## Elevator Pitch
*Imagine if Amazon ran deliveries during the apocalypse, powered by disposable workers 3D-printed out of recycled human goo. Now imagine you‚Äôre the one managing them. That‚Äôs DDDS.*  

It‚Äôs dark comedy, B-movie horror, and corporate satire all smashed into one game about packages, mutants, and the futility of human life under capitalism.

## Core Features (Current & Planned)
-  **Driving phase**: Navigate your truck to delivery zones and park in corporate-approved stations  
-  **Employee printing**: Spawn disposable workers from the back of the truck using collected Bio-Matter  
-  **Drone ‚Üî Employee connection loop**: Stay close or lose control (and maybe your Employee)  
-  **Package pickup & drop system**: If an Employee dies, the package must be retrieved by the next  
-  **Hazards & enemies**: Traps, mutants, rival mascots, and general apocalyptic chaos  
-  **Obituary generator + Memorial Wall**: Every Employee death gets logged, screenshotted, and remembered (sort of)  
-  **Corporate UI**: Satirical OS terminal guiding you through ‚Äúsafe and efficient‚Äù deliveries
