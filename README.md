# Dooms Day Delivery Service (DDDS)

**Dooms Day Delivery Service** is a satirical B-horror delivery game built in **Unreal Engine 5**.  
You play as the **Asset Manager**, remotely operating disposable 3D-printed Employees via drone.  
Your mission: deliver packages through apocalyptic hazards, collect bio-matter, and ignore the corporate propaganda telling you everything is fine.
