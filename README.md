# Dooms Day Delivery Service (DDDS)

**Dooms Day Delivery Service** is a satirical B-horror delivery game built in **Unreal Engine 5**.  
You play as the **Asset Manager**, remotely operating disposable 3D-printed Employees via drone.  
Your mission: deliver packages through apocalyptic hazards, collect bio-matter, and ignore the corporate propaganda telling you everything is fine.

## Features (Current & Planned)
- Drone ↔ Employee connection loop (stay close or lose control)  
- 3D-printed Employee lives powered by collected **Bio-Matter**  
- Package pickup & drop system (death → package retrieval)  
- Environmental hazards, rival mascots, and apocalyptic chaos  
- Employee **obituary generator** + **Memorial Wall**  
- Satirical corporate UI styled like an OS terminal
